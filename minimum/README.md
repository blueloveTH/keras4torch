# You have discovered the mini-version!

Here is the *mini-version* of `keras4torch`.

It is a single `.py` file with less than 300 lines of code but contains almost all training features of the standard pypi version.

You can use it for study or modify it as your template. Check the [MNIST example](MNIST_example_mini.ipynb).
